                <h3>Understanding Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
                <p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that gradually deteriorates memory, cognitive abilities, and the ability to perform everyday tasks. It’s the most common cause of dementia, impacting millions worldwide and creating challenges for individuals, families, and caregivers alike.</p>
                <p>Symptoms include memory loss, confusion, difficulty with speech and understanding, and changes in behavior. As the disease progresses, it impacts an individual’s ability to live independently, ultimately requiring full-time care.</p>
